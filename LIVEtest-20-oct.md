# Live Production Testing Guide - October 20, 2025

## üéØ Testing Objective
Verify all critical fixes work on production (Vercel deployment):
1. ‚úÖ Login loop fix for existing users
2. ‚úÖ Conditional survey logic (questions show/hide based on answers)
3. ‚úÖ Survey saves persist correctly
4. ‚úÖ New user onboarding flow works end-to-end

---

## üìã Test Accounts

### Option 1: Find Existing Test Accounts in Database

**Run this query in Supabase SQL Editor:**
```sql
-- Find all test accounts with their survey status
SELECT
  p.user_id,
  p.email,
  p.full_name,
  p.city,
  usr.completion_pct as survey_completion,
  usr.current_step as survey_step,
  p.created_at
FROM profiles p
LEFT JOIN user_survey_responses usr ON p.user_id = usr.user_id
WHERE
  p.email LIKE '%test%' OR
  p.email LIKE '%tester%' OR
  p.full_name LIKE '%test%'
ORDER BY p.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Option 2: Known Test Accounts from Session Logs

Based on today's session logs, we have:
- **Email:** `tester69@tester.com`
- **User ID:** `78d58a2a-9c8e-44e5-9f87-478d44c0249c`
- **Status:** Existing user, has some survey data

### Option 3: Create Fresh Test Accounts

You'll create these during testing:
1. **New User Test 1:** `newuser-oct20-1@test.com` / Password: `Test123456!`
2. **New User Test 2:** `newuser-oct20-2@test.com` / Password: `Test123456!`

---

### TEST 4: Conditional Logic (CRITICAL - Not Working on Production)

**This is the main issue you reported. Let's test thoroughly.**

**Setup:**
- Either continue from TEST 3, or
- Use existing user and navigate to survey
- Make sure you're on a fresh survey or early questions

---

#### Test 4.1: Q3 ‚Üí Q3b Conditional (Simple Test)

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to Q3: "How do you describe your sexual orientation?"
2. **Test A - Should SHOW Q3b:**
   - Select: `Bisexual` (or `Pansexual`, `Queer`, or `Other`)

3. Go back to Q3 (use browser back button)
4. **Test B - Should HIDE Q3b:**
   - Change to: `Gay` (or `Lesbian`, `Straight`)
   - Click "Next"
   - ‚úÖ **PASS if:** Q3b is skipped, goes directly to Q3c or Q4
   - ‚ùå **FAIL if:** Q3b still appears

**Browser Console Check:**
- Look for: `[logic-parser]` errors
- If errors appear, take screenshot

---

#### Test 4.2: Q6 ‚Üí Q7/Q8 Conditional (Critical Test)

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to Q6: "What relationship style(s) interest you?"
2. **Test A - Should SHOW Q7 and Q8:**
   - Select: `Open relationship` (or `Polyamory`)

3. Go back to Q6
4. **Test B - Should HIDE Q7 and Q8:**
   - Change to: `Monogamy` only
   - Click "Next"
   - ‚úÖ **PASS if:** Q7 and Q8 are both skipped
   - ‚úÖ **PASS if:** Goes to Q9 instead
   - ‚ùå **FAIL if:** Q7 or Q8 still appear

**Why This Test is Critical:**
- This was the main conditional logic you reported as broken
- Q7/Q8 display logic: `"Show if Q6 includes 'Open relationship' OR Q6 includes 'Polyamory' OR Q6 includes 'Don\\'t know yet'"`

---

#### Test 4.3: Q6c ‚Üí Q6d Conditional (Cascade Test)

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to Q6a: "How would you like to meet people here?"

   - Change to: `Together only`
   - Click "Next"
   - ‚úÖ **PASS if:** Q6d is skipped
   - ‚ùå **FAIL if:** Q6d still appears

---

#### Test 4.4: Complex Conditional - Q10 (Advanced Test)

**Note:** This has a complex compound condition that was causing parser errors.

**Setup:**
1. Make sure you answered:
   - Q4 (relationship status)
   - Q6 (relationship styles)

**Test Scenarios:**

**Scenario A - Should SHOW Q10:**
- Q4 = `Single` AND Q6 includes `Monogamy` ‚Üí Q10 should appear
- Q4 = `Single` AND Q6 includes `Polyamory` ‚Üí Q10 should appear

**Scenario B - Should HIDE Q10:**
- Q4 = `Single` AND Q6 = `Open relationship` only ‚Üí Q10 should be hidden
- Q4 = `Married` AND Q6 = `Monogamy` ‚Üí Q10 should be hidden

**Steps:**
1. Answer Q4 and Q6 according to Scenario A
2. Navigate through survey
3. ‚úÖ **PASS if:** Q10 "Which attachment style..." appears when expected
4. ‚ùå **FAIL if:** Q10 doesn't follow the rules above

**Browser Console:**
- Watch for: `[logic-parser] Unable to parse logic: "(Q4='Single'"` errors
- If this error appears, the fix didn't deploy properly

---

### TEST 5: Removed Questions (Verification)

**Verify these questions DO NOT appear anywhere in survey:**

‚ùå **Should be GONE:**
1. Q5 - "What's your ZIP code?" (already asked in signup)
2. Q5a - "Share precise location?"
3. Q17 - "Do you have or want children?"
4. Q17a - "Any dietary preferences or allergies?"

**Look for these errors (should NOT appear):**

‚ùå **Auth/Session Errors:**
```
[API /survey/save] ‚ùå NO SESSION FOUND
Failed to save survey data
Session expired
```

‚ùå **Logic Parser Errors:**
```
[logic-parser] Unable to parse logic: "(Show if Q4='Single'"
[logic-parser] Unable to parse logic: "(Q6 includes 'Monogamy'"
```

‚ùå **Cookie Errors:**
```
Supabase cookies found: 0
No cookies available
```

‚úÖ **Good Signs (should see):**

## üö® CRITICAL DISCREPANCIES FOUND

### 1. **Q3 (Sexual Orientation) - Type Mismatch**
- **CSV Spec:** `single` (single select)
- **Current Code:** `multiselect`
- **Impact:** Users can select multiple orientations when spec says single choice only
- **Fix Required:** Change type from `multiselect` to `select`

### 2. **Q4 (Relationship Status) - Options Mismatch**
- **CSV Spec:** Single, Dating, Married, Partnered, **Couple**, In a polycule, Solo Poly, **Exploring**, Prefer not to say
- **Current Code:** Single, Partnered, Married, In a polycule, Solo Poly, **It's complicated**, Other
- **Missing:** "Dating", "Couple", "Exploring", "Prefer not to say"
- **Extra:** "It's complicated", "Other"
- **Impact:** Conditional logic referencing "Dating" or "Couple" won't work
- **Fix Required:** Update options to match CSV exactly

### 3. **Q5 & Q5a (ZIP Code & Location) - Incorrectly Removed**
- **CSV Spec:** Q5 and Q5a are **REQUIRED** questions in the survey
- **Current Code:** Removed with comment "already collected during signup"
- **Conflict:** CSV shows these as core survey questions, not signup questions
- **Impact:** Question numbering is off, Q6 becomes Q5 internally
- **Fix Required:** Decision needed - Keep in survey per CSV, or update CSV spec?

### 4. **Q6 (Relationship Orientation) - Options Completely Different**
- **CSV Spec:** **Monogamous**, **Monogamish**, **ENM**, **Polyamorous**, **Open**, **Exploring**
- **Current Code:** **Monogamy**, **Open relationship**, **Polyamory**, Relationship anarchy, Swinging, **Don't know yet**, Other
- **Mismatch:** Different wording and missing key option "Monogamish" and "ENM"
- **Impact:** Conditional logic breaks because it references "Monogamish" which doesn't exist
- **Fix Required:** Update options to match CSV exactly

### 5. **Q6c (Couple Connection) - WRONG CONDITIONAL TRIGGER** üö®
- **CSV Spec:** `Show if Q4 INCLUDES {Dating, Married, Partnered, Couple}`
- **Current Code:** `Show if Q6a includes 'couple'`
- **Impact:** Question shows based on WRONG trigger - totally broken logic!
- **Fix Required:** Change displayLogic to check Q4 relationship status, not Q6a connection type

### 6. **Q7 & Q8 (Exclusivity) - Conditional Logic Needs Update**
- **CSV Spec:** `Show if Q6 INCLUDES {Monogamish, Open, Polyamorous, Don't know yet}`
- **Current Code:** `Show if Q6 includes 'Open relationship' OR Q6 includes 'Polyamory' OR Q6 includes 'Don't know yet'`
- **Impact:** Missing "Monogamish" option, option names don't match
- **Fix Required:** Update to match CSV option names exactly

### 7. **Q10 (Attachment Style) - Conditional Logic Incomplete**
- **CSV Spec:**
  - Show if `(Q4 = Single AND Q6 = {Monogamous, Monogamish, Polyamorous})`
  - **OR** `(Q4 = {Dating, Married, Partnered, Couple} AND Q6 = Polyamorous)`
- **Current Code:**
  - `(Q4='Single' AND (Q6 includes 'Monogamy' OR Q6 includes 'Polyamory'))`
  - **OR** `((Q4='Partnered' OR Q4='Married') AND Q6 includes 'Polyamory')`
- **Missing:** "Dating" and "Couple" in second condition, "Monogamish" in both
- **Impact:** Question won't show for users in "Dating" or "Couple" status
- **Fix Required:** Add missing Q4 status options and "Monogamish"

### 8. **Q12 (Conflict Resolution) - Conditional Logic Needs Update**
- **CSV Spec:** `Q4 = Single AND Q6 INCLUDES {Monogamous, Monogamish, Polyamorous}`
- **Current Code:** `Q4='Single' AND (Q6 includes 'Monogamy' OR Q6 includes 'Polyamory')`
- **Missing:** "Monogamish" option
- **Impact:** Won't show for monogamish users
- **Fix Required:** Add "Monogamish" to condition

### 9. **Q17, Q17a, Q17b - Correctly Hidden** ‚úÖ
- **CSV Spec:** "Delete or Hide (For Now - NOT MVP)"
- **Current Code:** Commented out
- **Status:** **CORRECT** - These are properly hidden

## üîß IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Blocking Issues)

#### 1.1 Fix Q6 Options (Enables All Conditional Logic)
**File:** `lib/survey/questions.ts:165-180`

**Current:**
```typescript
options: [
  'Monogamy',
  'Open relationship',
  'Polyamory',
  'Relationship anarchy',
  'Swinging',
  'Don\'t know yet',
  'Other'
]
```

**Change to:**
```typescript
options: [
  'Monogamous',
  'Monogamish',
  'ENM',
  'Polyamorous',
  'Open',
  'Exploring'
]
```

#### 1.2 Fix Q4 Options (Enables Q6c and Q10 Logic)
**File:** `lib/survey/questions.ts:140-155`

**Current:**
```typescript
options: [
  'Single',
  'Partnered',
  'Married',
  'In a polycule',
  'Solo Poly',
  'It\'s complicated',
  'Other'
]
```

**Change to:**
```typescript
options: [
  'Single',
  'Dating',
  'Married',
  'Partnered',
  'Couple',
  'In a polycule',
  'Solo Poly',
  'Exploring',
  'Prefer not to say'
]
```

#### 1.3 Fix Q3 Type (Single Select Instead of Multi)
**File:** `lib/survey/questions.ts:82-100`

**Current:**
```typescript
{
  id: 'q3_sexual_orientation',
  csvId: 'Q3',
  label: 'How do you describe your sexual orientation?',
  type: 'multiselect',
  ...
}
```

**Change to:**
```typescript
{
  id: 'q3_sexual_orientation',
  csvId: 'Q3',
  label: 'Sexual orientation',
  type: 'select',  // Changed from multiselect
  options: [
    'Straight',
    'Gay/Lesbian',
    'Bisexual',
    'Pansexual',
    'Queer',
    'Fluid',
    'Asexual',
    'Demisexual',
    'Questioning/Unsure',
    'Prefer not to say',
    'Other'
  ],
  ...
}
```

#### 1.4 Fix Q6c Conditional Logic (CRITICAL!)
**File:** `lib/survey/questions.ts:210-223`

**Current:**
```typescript
displayLogic: "Show if Q6a includes 'couple'"
```

**Change to:**
```typescript
displayLogic: "Q4 in {Dating,Married,Partnered,Couple}"
```

#### 1.5 Update Q7 & Q8 Conditional Logic
**File:** `lib/survey/questions.ts:234-257`

**Current:**
```typescript
displayLogic: "Show if Q6 includes 'Open relationship' OR Q6 includes 'Polyamory' OR Q6 includes 'Don\\'t know yet'"
```

**Change to:**
```typescript
displayLogic: "Q6 in {Monogamish,Open,Polyamorous,Exploring}"
```

#### 1.6 Update Q10 Conditional Logic
**File:** `lib/survey/questions.ts:297-311`

**Current:**
```typescript
displayLogic: "(Q4='Single' AND (Q6 includes 'Monogamy' OR Q6 includes 'Polyamory')) OR ((Q4='Partnered' OR Q4='Married') AND Q6 includes 'Polyamory')"
```

**Change to:**
```typescript
displayLogic: "(Q4='Single' AND Q6 in {Monogamous,Monogamish,Polyamorous}) OR (Q4 in {Dating,Married,Partnered,Couple} AND Q6='Polyamorous')"
```

#### 1.7 Update Q12 Conditional Logic
**File:** `lib/survey/questions.ts:337-351`

**Current:**
```typescript
displayLogic: "Q4='Single' AND (Q6 includes 'Monogamy' OR Q6 includes 'Polyamory')"
```

**Change to:**
```typescript
displayLogic: "Q4='Single' AND Q6 in {Monogamous,Monogamish,Polyamorous}"
```

### Phase 2: Q5/Q5a Decision (Needs User Input)

**Question for User:**

The CSV spec shows Q5 (ZIP code) and Q5a (precise location) as **required survey questions**, but the current implementation removed them with the comment "already collected during signup."

**Options:**

**Option A: Keep Removed (Current Approach)**
- Pros: Avoids asking users twice
- Cons: Breaks CSV spec, question numbering is off
- Action: Update CSV spec to remove Q5/Q5a

**Option B: Re-add to Survey**
- Pros: Matches CSV spec exactly
- Cons: Asks users for ZIP twice (signup + survey)
- Action: Restore Q5/Q5a questions in code

**Option C: Conditional Display**
- Pros: Only asks if not provided during signup
- Cons: More complex logic
- Action: Add displayLogic: "Show if ZIP not collected in signup"

**Recommendation:** Option A - Keep removed, update CSV spec to reflect that ZIP is collected during signup.

### Phase 3: Additional Updates

#### 3.1 Update Q3a Conditional Logic
**Current:** Already correct ‚úÖ
```typescript
displayLogic: "Show if Q3 in {Bisexual,Pansexual,Queer,Fluid,Other} AND Q4 in {Single,Solo Poly,Dating}"
```

**Note:** Will need to update after Q4 options are fixed to use exact CSV option names.

#### 3.2 Review All Question Labels
Several questions have different labels in CSV vs code:
- Q3: "Sexual orientation" (CSV) vs "How do you describe your sexual orientation?" (Code)
- Q6: "Relationship orientation preference" (CSV) vs "What relationship style(s) interest you?" (Code)

**Decision Needed:** Keep friendly wording in code, or match CSV exactly?

## üéØ Summary for User Review

### What We Found:
1. **7 questions have mismatches** between CSV spec and current code
2. **Q6c has completely wrong conditional logic** (checks Q6a instead of Q4)
3. **Q6 and Q4 option names don't match CSV**, breaking all conditional logic
4. **Q3 is multiselect in code but single-select in CSV**
5. **Q5/Q5a are in CSV but removed from code** (conflict needs resolution)

### What Needs to Change:
1. **Update Q4 and Q6 options** to match CSV exactly
2. **Fix all conditional logic** to reference correct option names
3. **Change Q3 to single-select**
4. **Fix Q6c trigger** from Q6a to Q4
5. **Decide on Q5/Q5a** - remove from CSV or add back to survey?

### Impact:
Once these changes are made:
- ‚úÖ All conditional logic will work correctly
- ‚úÖ Questions will show/hide based on CSV spec rules
- ‚úÖ Survey will match the canonical specification exactly
- ‚úÖ No more confusion about question numbering

### Next Steps:
1. **Review this analysis**
2. **Decide on Q5/Q5a approach** (keep removed vs re-add)
3. **Approve implementation plan**
4. **Execute Phase 1 critical fixes**
5. **Test thoroughly**
6. **Deploy to production**
