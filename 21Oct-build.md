# October 21, 2025 - Build Summary & Production Deployment Plan

## üéØ Session Overview
Fixed critical onboarding and survey issues that were blocking both new and existing users. All fixes tested and verified on localhost. Now pivoting to deploy and verify on production (Vercel).

---

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed (Localhost Verified)

### 1. **Existing User Login Loop** üîÑ ‚Üí ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem:** Returning users got stuck in infinite loop: login ‚Üí signup ‚Üí login ‚Üí signup...

**Root Cause:**
- `getResumeStep()` function checked ALL incomplete steps including Step 1 (signup)
- Returned `/auth/signup` for authenticated users who hadn't marked signup as complete
- Signup page didn't detect already-authenticated users and redirect them

**Fixes Applied:**
- **File:** `lib/onboarding/flow.ts:272-284`
  - Added logic to skip Step 1 (signup) for authenticated users
  - If user is calling this function, they're already authenticated

- **File:** `app/auth/signup/page.tsx:32-54`
  - Added `useEffect` to detect authenticated users on signup page
  - Automatically redirects them to their correct destination via `getResumeStep()`

**Result:** Existing users now go to dashboard (if complete) or resume at their last incomplete onboarding step.

---

### 2. **Conditional Survey Logic Not Working** üß© ‚Üí ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem:** Questions weren't showing/hiding based on previous answers as specified in CSV.

**Missing Implementations:**
- Q7 (emotional exclusivity) - should show for non-monogamous styles
- Q8 (sexual exclusivity) - should show for non-monogamous styles
- Q10 (attachment style) - complex compound condition
- Q12 (conflict resolution) - specific to single/monogamous users

**Fixes Applied:**
- **File:** `lib/survey/questions.ts`
  - Added `csvId: 'Q6'` to q6_relationship_styles (required for references)
  - Added `csvId: 'Q7'` and display logic to q7_emotional_exclusivity
  - Added `csvId: 'Q8'` and display logic to q8_sexual_exclusivity
  - Added `csvId: 'Q10'` and display logic to q10_attachment_style
  - Added `csvId: 'Q12'` and display logic to q12_conflict_resolution

**Syntax Errors Fixed:**
- Q10 had: `"(Show if Q4='Single' AND ..."` ‚Üí Fixed to: `"(Q4='Single' AND ..."`
- Q12 had: `"Show if Q4='Single' AND ..."` ‚Üí Fixed to: `"Q4='Single' AND ..."`

**Result:** Questions now properly show/hide based on conditional logic. Tested with various answer combinations on localhost.

---

### 3. **Questions Removed Per CSV Specs** üóëÔ∏è ‚Üí ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**File:** `lib/survey/questions.ts:471-505`
- ‚ùå Commented out Q17 (children) - NOT MVP per Conditional Branching CSV
- ‚ùå Commented out Q17a (dietary) - NOT MVP per Conditional Branching CSV
- ‚ùå Commented out Q17b (pets) - NOT MVP per Conditional Branching CSV

**File:** `lib/survey/questions.ts:156-169`
- ‚ùå Removed q5_zip_code - Already collected during signup
- ‚ùå Removed q5a_precise_location - Already collected during signup

**Result:** Survey is now shorter and doesn't ask duplicate questions.

---

### 4. **Survey Save Errors Fixed (Previous Session)** üíæ ‚Üí ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem:** Survey answers weren't saving, users getting "Failed to save" errors.

**Root Cause:**
- Next.js 15 Server Actions don't receive cookies properly
- Middleware wasn't setting up cookies for API routes before checking auth

**Fixes Applied:**
- Converted server actions to API routes: `/api/survey/load` and `/api/survey/save`
- Fixed middleware to set up Supabase cookies BEFORE route classification checks
- Changed client from localStorage-only to cookie-based sessions (`createBrowserClient`)

**Result:** Survey saves work reliably, cookies propagate correctly to API routes.

## üìä Testing Results (Localhost)

### ‚úÖ New User Flow
1. Signup ‚Üí Auto-login ‚Üí Expectations ‚Üí Welcome ‚Üí Identity ‚Üí Verification (skip) ‚Üí Survey Intro ‚Üí Survey
2. Survey answers save automatically
3. Conditional logic shows/hides questions correctly
4. Progress persists across page refreshes

### ‚úÖ Existing User Flow
1. Login ‚Üí Redirected to correct step (not stuck in loop)
2. If survey incomplete ‚Üí Resume at survey with saved answers
3. If survey complete ‚Üí Go to dashboard
4. No more redirect to signup page

### ‚úÖ Conditional Logic
- Q7/Q8 appear when Q6 includes non-monogamous options ‚úÖ
- Q3a/Q3b appear based on sexual orientation ‚úÖ
- Q6c/Q6d cascade correctly ‚úÖ
- Q10/Q12 follow complex conditions ‚úÖ

---

## üö® Known Issue: Production Deployment

**Current Problem:** Conditional logic working on localhost but NOT on deployed Vercel version.

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Build cache** - Vercel may be serving cached build from before fixes
2. **Environment variables** - Different Supabase URL/keys between local and production
3. **Build optimization** - Production build may tree-shake or optimize differently
4. **TypeScript compilation** - Questions.ts changes may not be in deployed build

---

## üöÄ Pivot to Production: Deployment Strategy

### Step 1: Commit and Push Changes
```bash
# Stage all modified files
git add .

# Create commit with all fixes
git commit -m "fix: resolve login loop, conditional logic, and survey issues

- Fix existing user login loop by skipping signup step for authenticated users
- Add conditional display logic for Q7, Q8, Q10, Q12
- Remove duplicate ZIP code questions (already in signup)
- Hide Q17, Q17a, Q17b per MVP requirements
- Fix logic parser syntax errors for compound conditions
- Add signup page redirect protection for authenticated users

# Push to trigger Vercel deployment
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Monitor Vercel Deployment
1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Watch deployment status
3. Check build logs for errors
4. Wait for "Ready" status

### Step 3: Test Production After Deployment
**Test Checklist:**
- [ ] Existing user can login without loop
- [ ] New user signup flow works end-to-end
- [ ] Survey saves persist
- [ ] Conditional logic shows/hides questions correctly
- [ ] No console errors in browser
- [ ] Middleware logs show correct behavior

### Step 4: Debugging Production Issues

#### If Conditional Logic Still Broken:
1. **Check browser console** for logic parser errors
2. **Verify Supabase connection** - Check cookies in Application tab
3. **Force cache clear** on Vercel:
   ```bash
   # In Vercel dashboard ‚Üí Deployments ‚Üí ... ‚Üí Redeploy
   # Select "Force rebuild without using cache"
   ```
4. **Check production build locally:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run start
   # Test on localhost:3000 in production mode
   ```

#### If Login Loop Returns:
1. Check server logs in Vercel Functions tab
2. Look for `[FlowController]` and `[Signup]` logs
3. Verify database has survey data for test users
4. Check middleware logs for redirect decisions

3. ‚è≥ Push to trigger Vercel deployment
4. ‚è≥ Monitor build and deployment status
5. ‚è≥ Test production thoroughly
6. ‚è≥ Debug any production-specific issues

### If Production Works
1. Mark all issues as resolved
2. Test with real users
3. Monitor for any edge cases
4. Prepare for next feature phase

### If Production Has Issues
1. Compare localhost vs production behavior
2. Check build logs for warnings
3. Verify environment variables
4. Force cache clear and rebuild
5. Debug using production logs
6. Apply hotfixes as needed

## üìù Important Notes

### Git Workflow
- **Branch:** Currently on `main` (or current branch)
- **Remote:** Push triggers automatic Vercel deployment
- **Build time:** ~2-5 minutes typically
- **Rollback:** Can revert to previous deployment in Vercel dashboard

### Testing Strategy
- Test existing user FIRST (most problematic flow)
- Then test new user signup
- Finally test conditional logic thoroughly
- Check browser console for client-side errors
- Check Vercel logs for server-side errors

### Known Working State
- ‚úÖ All features working on localhost
- ‚è≥ Conditional logic needs verification on production
- ‚è≥ Login loop fix needs verification on production
