Perfect --- the last one to round out the core context set is **haevn_onboarding_flow.md**.

This will capture Rik's onboarding draft + survey master in a structured way so Claude always knows what steps to scaffold.

Here's a clean draft:

* * * * *

**haevn_onboarding_flow.md**
============================

**Overview**
------------

Onboarding in HAEVN is **mandatory** and **multi-step**, ensuring trust, privacy, and accurate matching.

Users cannot access discovery until onboarding + survey are complete.

* * * * *

**Steps**
---------

### **1\. Account Creation**

-   Inputs: Name, Email/Phone, Zip Code, Password/Magic Link.

-   Autofill city from zip → check against city status (live/waitlist).

-   Privacy/trust subtext displayed.

-   Profile auto-created in "Draft" state.

* * * * *

### **2\. Expectation Setting**

-   Screen explains: ~10--15 min, required for connections.

-   Auto-save enabled.

-   Tone: "This is what makes HAEVN different."

* * * * *

### **3\. Orientation to HAEVN**

-   Educational cards (not just text):

    -   Verified community

    -   Modern relationship structures

    -   Required survey for meaningful matches

    -   Privacy-first model

* * * * *

### **4\. Identity & Relationship Structure**

-   Choose profile type: **Solo / With Partner / Pod**.

-   Select relationship orientation: **Open, Poly, Monogamish, Swinger, Curious**.

-   This defines whether invites are required (for Partner B/C).

* * * * *

### **5\. Verification**

-   Selfie + ID capture.

-   Required before introductions (but can skip temporarily).

-   Profiles stay "PendingApproval" until verification complete.

* * * * *

### **6\. Survey Introduction**

-   Sets tone: "This is the heart of HAEVN."

-   Explains progress bar, auto-save, and "Why we ask" tooltips.

-   Tone: weighty, unique, serious.

* * * * *

### **7\. Survey Flow**

-   Sections: Identity, Style, Lifestyle, Erotic Map, Optional Kink, Personality.

-   One Q per screen.

-   Individual + shared sections (depending on profile type).

-   Skip logic handled via survey master (e.g., NSFW sections optional).

* * * * *

### **8\. Completion**

-   Celebration state.

-   Unlocks Dashboard (Connections/Events/Resources).

-   Message: "Matches are based on your survey + profile."

-   Profile status → Live (if verified), otherwise Draft/PendingApproval.

* * * * *

**Special Modes**
-----------------

-   **Couples/Pods**: Partner A creates, sends invites to B/C. Shared survey sections require all partners.

-   **Advocate Mode**: Partner A completes everything solo, marked as "Managed by one partner."

-   **Waitlist Users**: Can complete onboarding + survey, but discovery locked until city = live.

* * * * *

⚡ This gives Claude a **step-by-step onboarding backbone** to wire into screens and logic.

Do you want me to make this lean (just flow & states) or **expand with all UI notes** from Rik's draft (like subtext, tone-of-voice, and trust cues)?
