## üéØ PENDING TASKS - PHASED APPROACH

### **PHASE 1: Handshake/Matching System (PRIORITY 1)**
*Estimated: 3-4 hours*

#### Goal
Enable users to find matches, send/receive handshake invitations, and establish connections

#### Database Status
‚úÖ Already have:
- `handshakes` table (a_partnership, b_partnership, a_consent, b_consent)
- `partnership_invites` table (for email invitations)
- RLS policies for handshakes

#### Implementation Steps

**1A. Match Discovery & Filtering (1 hour)**
- Build `/matches` page to display compatible partnerships
- Use existing `getMatches()` function from `lib/actions/matching.ts`
- Filter by city, preferences, survey compatibility
- Display match cards with:
  - Partner names (anonymized until handshake)
  - Compatibility score
  - City/location
  - "Send Handshake" button

**1B. Handshake Request Flow (1.5 hours)**
- Create `SendHandshakeModal` component
  - Shows preview of partnership being contacted
  - Optional personal message
  - Confirm/Cancel actions
- Update handshakes table: `INSERT` with `a_consent = true`, `b_consent = false`
- Show "Pending" state in UI
- Add notification/badge for receiver

**1C. Handshake Response Flow (1 hour)**
- Create `HandshakeNotifications` component
  - Show incoming handshake requests
  - Display requester info (name, bio preview, city)
- Build `AcceptHandshakeModal` component
  - Review requester details
  - Accept/Decline actions
- On Accept: Update `b_consent = true`
- Trigger unlock: Share full profiles, photos, contact info

**1D. Connected State (30 min)**
- Update `/connections` page to show accepted handshakes
- Display connected partnerships with full details
- Add "Message" button (placeholder for Phase 3)
- Show connection date

#### Questions/Decisions
- **Q1:** Should we limit handshake requests per day? (e.g., 5 per day to prevent spam)
- **Q2:** What happens to private photos after handshake? Auto-grant access or require additional consent?
- **Q3:** Notification system: In-app only, or also email?
- **Q4:** Should declined handshakes be tracked? (for analytics, prevent re-requesting)

#### Success Criteria
- [ ] Users can browse matches from dashboard
- [ ] Users can send handshake requests
- [ ] Users receive notifications of incoming requests
- [ ] Users can accept/decline requests
- [ ] Connected partnerships show full profiles + photos
- [ ] Dashboard reflects connection count

---

### **PHASE 2: Onboarding Survey Enhancements (PRIORITY 2)**
*Estimated: 2-3 hours*

#### Goal
Add micro-celebrations after each section completion to improve UX and completion rates

#### Current State
- Survey works but no feedback between sections
- Users might feel lost or uncertain about progress

#### Implementation Steps

**2A. Section Completion Celebrations (1.5 hours)**
- Create `SectionCompleteModal` component
  - Animated checkmark or confetti effect
  - Encouraging message per section:
    - Section 1: "Great start! üéâ"
    - Section 2: "You're halfway there! üí™"
    - Section 3: "Almost done! ‚≠ê"
  - Progress indicator (e.g., "3 of 6 complete")
  - "Continue" button
- Trigger modal after each section submission
- Use libraries: `react-confetti` or `lottie-react` for animations

**2B. Progress Persistence (30 min)**
- Visual progress bar at top of survey
- Save completion_pct to database after each section
- Show section checkmarks for completed sections

**2C. Survey Polish (1 hour)**
- Add section summaries before final submission
- "Edit" buttons to go back to previous sections
- Final celebration on 100% completion
- Smooth transition to payment/dashboard

#### Questions/Decisions
- **Q5:** Should we allow users to skip sections and come back later?
- **Q6:** Auto-save answers on blur, or require explicit "Save" button?
- **Q7:** Show completion percentage on partner profile?

#### Success Criteria
- [ ] Celebration modal after each section
- [ ] Visual progress indicator
- [ ] Users can navigate back to edit answers
- [ ] Final celebration on completion
- [ ] Smoother onboarding flow

---

### **PHASE 3: ID Verification + Stripe Integration (PRIORITY 3)**
*Estimated: 4-5 hours*

#### Goal
Add identity verification before payment to ensure safety and authenticity

#### Implementation Approach

**3A. Stripe Identity Integration (2 hours)**
- Use [Stripe Identity](https://stripe.com/docs/identity) for ID verification
- Create `/verify-identity` page (before payment)
- Flow: Survey Complete ‚Üí ID Verification ‚Üí Payment
- Set up Stripe Identity webhook to receive verification results
- Store verification status in `profiles` table:
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN identity_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;
  ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN verification_session_id TEXT;
  ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN verified_at TIMESTAMPTZ;
  ```

**3B. Verification UI (1.5 hours)**
- Build `IdentityVerificationPage`:
  - Explain why verification is needed (safety, authenticity)
  - Stripe Identity embedded component
  - "Continue" button (disabled until verified)
- Add verification badge to profile
- Gate certain features behind verification (e.g., handshakes)

**3C. Payment Flow Update (1 hour)**
- Update onboarding flow:
  1. Complete Survey
  2. **Verify Identity** ‚Üê NEW STEP
  3. Select Membership Tier
  4. Payment
  5. Dashboard Access
- Block payment page if not verified
- Add verification status check in middleware

**3D. Admin Dashboard (Optional - 30 min)**
- Simple page to view verification stats
- Manual override for edge cases

#### Questions/Decisions
- **Q8:** Require verification before survey or after survey?
  - **Recommendation:** After survey (better conversion, users already invested)
- **Q9:** What features require verification?
  - **Recommendation:** Handshakes, messaging, photo sharing
- **Q10:** Free tier users need verification?
  - **Recommendation:** Yes, for safety across all tiers
- **Q11:** Verification expiration? Re-verify annually?
  - **Recommendation:** One-time verification, re-verify only if suspicious activity

#### Technical Setup Required
- [ ] Stripe Identity API keys (test + production)
- [ ] Webhook endpoint: `/api/webhooks/stripe-identity`
- [ ] Database schema updates
- [ ] RLS policies to restrict unverified users

#### Success Criteria
- [ ] Users redirected to verification after survey
- [ ] Stripe Identity flow embedded and working
- [ ] Verification status stored in database
- [ ] Verified badge shown on profile
- [ ] Payment page gated by verification
- [ ] Webhooks process verification results

## ü§î OPEN QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION

1. **Handshake Limits:** Daily limit on requests to prevent spam?
2. **Private Photo Access:** Automatic after handshake, or separate consent?
3. **Notifications:** In-app only, or email too?
4. **Verification Timing:** Before or after survey completion?
5. **Free Tier Verification:** Required for all users?
6. **Match Algorithm:** Current compatibility scoring sufficient?
7. **Survey Skipping:** Allow partial completion?
8. **Mobile Priority:** Which pages are most critical for mobile?

---

## üìä OVERALL PROGRESS ESTIMATE

- ‚úÖ **Foundation & Auth:** 100%
- ‚úÖ **Onboarding Survey:** 90% (needs celebrations)
- ‚úÖ **Partner Profile:** 95% (working well)
- ‚úÖ **Photo Management:** 100% (just completed!)
- üü° **Handshake System:** 30% (database ready, UI needed)
- üü° **Dashboard:** 60% (base exists, needs detail pages)
- üî¥ **ID Verification:** 0% (not started)
- üü° **Mobile Responsive:** 70% (needs testing)
- ‚úÖ **Deployment Pipeline:** 100%

**Estimated time to MVP:** 15-20 hours of focused development

---

## üí≠ STRATEGIC NOTES

### Why This Order?

1. **Handshakes First:** Core value proposition - connecting partners
2. **Survey Polish Next:** Improves conversion before adding verification
3. **ID Verification After:** Adds safety layer once core flow proven
4. **Polish Last:** Visual refinement after functionality complete

### Risk Mitigation

- **Handshake complexity:** Start with basic accept/decline, add messaging later
- **Stripe Identity:** Use test mode extensively before production
- **RLS policies:** Already fixed recursion, but test thoroughly with handshakes
- **Mobile issues:** Test early and often

### Success Metrics to Track

- Survey completion rate (target: >70%)
- Handshake acceptance rate (target: >40%)
- Time to first connection (target: <24 hours)
- Photo upload rate (target: >50% of users)
- Verification completion rate (target: >80%)
