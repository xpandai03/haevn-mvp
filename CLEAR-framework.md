# CLEAR Framework - Account Details & Avatar Upload

## C - Contextualize

### What are we building?
1. **Account Details Page** - A dedicated page where users can view and edit their account information (email, password, username, etc.)
2. **Avatar Upload via Click** - Users should be able to click on their profile picture circle to upload/change their avatar

### Why is this important?
- Account details is core functionality for any user account system
- Profile picture upload is a primary way users personalize their profile
- Currently, these features are missing or not easily accessible

### Current State
- Account details button exists but is disabled
- Avatar is shown but not clickable
- Photo upload functionality exists but requires going through a separate flow

## L - List Requirements

   - Email address
   - Username
   - Account creation date
   - Partnership status
2. Allow editing:
   - Username
   - Password (change password flow)
   - Email (with verification)
3. Danger zone:
   - Delete account option
4. Navigation:
   - Back button to profile
   - HAEVN branding consistent

### Avatar Upload Requirements
1. Click on avatar circle to trigger upload
2. File picker for image selection
